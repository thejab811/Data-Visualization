1. Column types - Categories/Dimension/Groups/Qualitative , Numerics/Metric/Quantitative, Dates, Location, Text
2. Granularity of data
3. Derive new metrics
	- Numerical column: Bin it
	- Text - No. of characters, words, sentences, hashtags, frequency of particular word
	- Date - Year, month, day, hour, second, evening/morning, weekday/holiday, Seasons
	- Location- Latitude, longitude, State, Country, Avg temperature, Population, GDP
4. Univariate Analysis
	- Dimension - Frequenct Count - Bar chart
	- Numerical - Distribution
			- Histogram, Boxplot (Outliers, skewness, distribution)
        - Text - Create word cloud to understand what are frequently used words
	- Date - Consider it is a dimension
5. Bivariate Analysis
	- 1 Dimension + 1 Metric - Barchart, x-axis(Dimension), y-axis(Metric), Summarize(Min, max, mean, median, Sum)
	- 2 Dimension: Heat Map (Color represents the frequency)
	- 2 Metric: Scatterplot (Outliers, Visual Grouping, Trend, Correlation)

6. Multivariate Analysis
	- 1 Dimension & 2 Metrics - Treemap (Size is metric, color is another metric, boxes for dimension)
                                  - Colored bar chart(bars for dimension, yaxis-metric, color-metric)
	- 2 Dimension & 2 Metrics - Scatter plot (Xaxis-metric, yaxis-metric, color-dimension,  symbol-dimension)
	- Many metrics - Scatter plot (xaxis, yaxis, color, size)
